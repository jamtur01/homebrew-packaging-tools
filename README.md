Packaging Tools
===============
This tap provides tools that may be useful to cross-platform package maintainers who use Homebrew on a Mac. Some of them already exist in Homebrew, and others are new formulas. The RPM formula is the same as upstream, except that it provides Python bindings; this is required by RPM Devtools.

For more information on Homebrew taps, see the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap).
